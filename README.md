### Demo 1
| **Category** | **Prompt** | **Success / Attempts** |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Interacting with various UI components to accomplish tasks | **Turn 1**: Search Britannica for a detailed map view of bear habitats  <br> **Turn 2**: Great! Now please check out the black, brown, and polar bear links and provide a concise general overview of their physical characteristics, specifically their differences. Oh, and save the links for me so I can access them quickly. | **10 / 10** |

### Demo 2
| **Category** | **Prompt** | **Success / Attempts** |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Interacting with various UI components to accomplish complicated tasks | Visit tagvenue.com and look for a concert hall that seats 150 people in London. I need it on Feb 22 2025 for the entire day from 9 am to 12 am, just make sure it is under £90 per hour. <br> Oh could you check the filters section for appropriate filters and make sure there is parking and the entire thing is wheelchair accessible. | **8 / 10** |

## 🎯 How DigiMorph Operator Works
DigiMorph Operator follows a **three-step AI-driven workflow** to execute web interactions:

![How DigiMorph Operator Works](https://github.com/DigiMorphLab/Operator/blob/main/how_it_works.png)
This diagram visually represents how DigiMorph Operator processes **user input, GUI perception, reasoning, and action execution** to automate tasks effectively.

Given a user’s instruction, DigiMorph AI Agent operates through an iterative loop that integrates perception, reasoning, and action:
### **1️⃣ Perception 👁️**
- The AI **captures screenshots of the browsing environment** to **understand the current state** and process visual context.
- It analyzes on-screen elements to determine what actions are available.

### **2️⃣ Reasoning 🧠**
- Using an **advanced chain-of-thought process**, DigiMorph evaluates past actions, predicts optimal next steps, and refines its execution **dynamically**.
- It adapts based on **real-time interactions** to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

### **3️⃣ Action 🎭**
- The AI **clicks, scrolls, types, and interacts** just like a human, autonomously completing tasks.
- It intelligently **seeks user confirmation** for sensitive actions (e.g., login credentials, CAPTCHA verifications) to **maintain security**.

## 🌐 Why Use DigiMorph Operator?
- ✔ **AI-Driven Autonomy** – Automate tedious browsing tasks effortlessly.
- ✔ **Decentralized & Open** – No dependency on centralized AI models.
- ✔ **Highly Adaptable** – Works with various UI interfaces and web applications.
- ✔ **Privacy-Preserving** – Keeps sensitive interactions secure.
